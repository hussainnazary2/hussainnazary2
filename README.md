- 👋 Hi, I’m @hussainnazary2  
- 👀 I’m interested in AI agents, automation, and bringing Persian-language tools to life using open-source technologies.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning LangGraph, LangChain, and Python to build intelligent systems that help users interact with English content in Persian/Dari.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI tools, lightweight inference pipelines, and educational content focused on Persian-speaking communities.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hussain-nazary-188b4385) or here on GitHub.  
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m building AI-powered animated avatars that speak Persian — combining storytelling, tech, and art in one go!
