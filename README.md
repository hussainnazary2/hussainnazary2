# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hussain Nazary

ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m an AI enthusiast building intelligent tools using **open-source LLMs**, automation frameworks, and lightweight inference pipelines. Iâ€™m especially interested in **AI agents**, smart assistants, and real-time automation systems that run efficiently â€” with or without the cloud.

---

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On
- Building **AI-powered agents** that read, summarize, and reason over documents
- Automating **email workflows**, task execution, and writing assistance
- Exploring **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Python** to create agentic, multi-step workflows
- Experimenting with **Mistral**, **LLaMA**, and other small/medium models via `llama.cpp`, `Ollama`, and `GGUF`

### ðŸ§  Technical Interests
```yaml
- AI Assistants:
    - Multi-modal input (PDF, Word, plain text)
    - Document + email automation
    - Context-aware message generation
- Lightweight Inference:
    - Local model deployment (CPU/GPU optimized)
    - RAG: embeddings + fast retrieval
- UI & UX:
    - PySide6 for desktop applications
    - Fast iteration and modular design
