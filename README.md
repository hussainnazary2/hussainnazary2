-  Hi, I’m Hussain Nazary 
-  I’m interested in AI agents, automation, and bringing Persian-language tools to life using open-source technologies.  
-  I’m currently learning LangGraph, LangChain, and Python to build intelligent systems that help users interact with English content in Persian/Dari.  
-  I’m looking to collaborate on AI tools, lightweight inference pipelines, and educational content focused on Persian-speaking communities.  
-  How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hussain-nazary-188b4385) or here on GitHub.  
-  Pronouns: he/him  
-  Fun fact: I’m building AI-powered animated avatars that speak Persian — combining storytelling, tech, and art in one go!
