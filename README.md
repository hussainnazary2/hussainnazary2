## 🚀 About Me  

I’m an independent **App Developer** passionate about turning ideas into **real, working applications**. Since early 2025, I’ve been developing **desktop apps** that combine modern web tech with **AI integrations** — always focusing on **privacy, simplicity, and usability**.  

- 🛠 Skilled in **Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Electron, Node.js**  
- 🤖 Experienced with **local LLMs (GGUF, Qwen, Mistral)** and **cloud models (Claude, OpenAI)**  
- 🔍 Strong at rapid prototyping, debugging, and shipping apps that just work  

I focus on **practical tools**, whether that means running AI locally for privacy, or building cross-platform apps that help people get things done.
