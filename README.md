## 🚀 About Me

I'm an independent AI practitioner on a mission to build tools that **solve real-world problems**, especially for **small businesses and communities in underrepresented regions**.

- 🧠 Passionate about **multilingual NLP**, local LLMs, and automation.
- 🛠 Skilled in **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **llama.cpp**, **Mistral**, and more.
- 🔍 Strong independent researcher — I love exploring open-source, low-resource solutions that keep data **on-device and private**.

I focus on making AI **simple and useful for everyone**, whether it's helping translate books into Persian & Pashto, or building secure local assistants for regions with limited internet.
